# ðŸŒ¾ **Smart Agricultural Connectivity Planner (SACP)**

Welcome to the **Smart Agricultural Connectivity Planner (SACP)**, a cutting-edge tool designed to revolutionize agricultural planning and connectivity. This project aims to empower farmers, agricultural planners, and stakeholders with data-driven insights and tools to optimize connectivity and resource allocation in agricultural areas.

---

## **Problem Statement**

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet farmers and agricultural planners face significant challenges in optimizing connectivity and resource allocation. Key issues include:

- **Limited Connectivity**: Rural agricultural areas often lack reliable communication networks, making it difficult to implement smart farming technologies.
- **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Without proper planning tools, farmers struggle to allocate resources like water, fertilizers, and equipment efficiently.
- **Lack of Data-Driven Insights**: Many agricultural decisions are made based on intuition rather than data, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

The **Smart Agricultural Connectivity Planner (SACP)** addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform for geospatial analysis, network planning, cost simulation, and data-driven decision-making.

## **Solution**

The **Smart Agricultural Connectivity Planner (SACP)** provides a suite of tools to address the challenges faced by farmers and agricultural planners:

1. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Upload geospatial data (e.g., GeoJSON, Shapefiles) to analyze terrain, vegetation, and elevation.
   - Visualize data on interactive maps with custom parameters like vegetation threshold and elevation range.

2. **Network Design**:
   - Plan optimal communication networks (e.g., LoRaWAN, 5G, Satellite) based on budget, terrain complexity, and technology type.
   - Get AI-powered recommendations for equipment, coverage, and maintenance.

3. **Cost Simulation**:
   - Simulate costs for equipment, installation, maintenance, and licensing.
   - Visualize cost breakdowns and ROI projections.

4. **Dashboard**:
   - Access a centralized dashboard for data-driven insights and visualizations.
   - Monitor key metrics like total area, vegetation cover, and cost breakdowns.
